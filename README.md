# Script-Generator-RNN
This recurrent neural network trains on a large number of scripts to generate a new unique script.

This is a project with the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
See the Jupyter Notebook for the operation of the network.

# RNN Architecture:

	Embedding layer
	LSTM layer
	Dropout layer
	Fully connected layer


The training data has been included in this repository: the entire nineth season of Seinfeld.

# To do:
- There are some background python files I would like to either bring to the surface or remove from the notebook. One being the unit code checker.
- Dynamically set the number of epochs.


# Example of a generated script:

jerry: robin's one who got the big salad.

george: what are we doing?

jerry: well, you know, i was in the neighborhood, and he asked me to be a good man?

jerry: no.

elaine: well, i'm not going to do it, i know.

kramer:(pointing to the door) you know, it's a little bit like you.... i mean, i know...

jerry: you know, you know, i'm not a little nervous about that.

elaine: i mean, i'm not paying for this.

elaine: well, i don't know. i mean i know, i think it moved.

elaine:(pointing at the phone) you can't go to the beach...(she leaves with the manager.)

george: i can't do this!

george:(to george) hey, i know...(to kramer) you know what?

jerry: yeah, i was in there, you know, and the whole thing is the biggest thing, it's not a fault. i mean, you know, it's the only thing i have to do.(george enters)

george:(quietly) well, you know, i don't think i'm gonna do anything.

jerry: no, i don't want to get a look for this.(jerry enters.)

george:(to george and elaine) hey, you know what i mean, a little more than i have to go.

morty:(to jerry) you know, i don't know.

jerry:(to elaine) you know, i don't know what you're talking about.

jerry: what?

jerry: no, no, no, no, i don't know, i think i can do it.(he walks away from jerry and kramer.)

jerry: i think i'm not in the mood for a long time.

george: you know, i don't know.
