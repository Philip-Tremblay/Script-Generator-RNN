# Script-Generator-RNN
This recurrent neural network trains on a large number of scripts to generate a new unique script.

This is a project with the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.
See the Jupyter Notebook for the operation of the network.

The training data has been included here. It is the entire ninthe season of Seinfeld.

To do:
Quite a bit. Still working through the project.  :)
