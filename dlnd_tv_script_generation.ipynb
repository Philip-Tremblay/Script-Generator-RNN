Next, with this larger batch size, I'd try increasing the size of the embedded and hidden layers.\n",

Is there a utility to dynamically calculate epochs or I could code one up?. I suspect reducing the sequence size to 8 from 10 would yield a lower loss and better performance. Though, the current settings satisfied the goal of a loss less than 3.5 with a final loss of 3.28. However, I would like to test for over fitting even with the dropout at 0.5.\n"
